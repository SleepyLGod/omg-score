```

## ⚙ Basic
+ The project is divided into 3 parts.
+ The [OmgSimplePlayer](./OmgSimplePlayer/) is the web applet to play standard midi files, and you can change the tempo.
+ The [OmgPianoPlayer](./OmgPianoPlayer) and [OmgPianoTranscription](./OmgPianoTranscription) is the web applet to convert mp3 files to midi files of piano pieces, and play them dynamically. The former is the frontend and the latter is the backend. You can see a three-dimensional piano model and adjust its spatial position freely. When the piano is being played, you can see the keys move with the notes, and you can also download the converted midi files and use them for other playback editors and editors.
